# Azure IoT TypeEdge

The **Azure IoT TypeEdge** introduces a strongly-typed flavor of the inherently loosely coupled vanilla [Azure IoT Edge](https:/azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/iot-edge/).

Specifically, **TypeEdge**:

- Removes all configuration burden from an IoT Edge application, because configuration can be now automatically generated.
- Introduces compile-time types checking across all modules
- Adds the ability to **emulate an IoT Edge device in-memory** with no containers involved
- Simplifies the IoT Edge development, down to an single F5 experience

Here is a quick video that demonstrates the value of **TypeEdge**

[![TypeEdge: Into](images/image.png)](https://youtu.be/_vWcpEjjtI0)

## Prerequisites

The minimum requirements to get started with **TypeEdge** are:
 - The latest [.NET Core SDK](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/release-notes/download-archives/2.1.0-download.md) (version 2.1.300). To find your current version, run 
`dotnet --version`
 -  An [Azure IoT Hub](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-create-through-portal) 

To be able to publish your application, you will also need:
 - [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/)
 - An [Azure Container Registry](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-registry/container-registry-get-started-portal), or any other secure container registry.
 - Temporarily, you'll need your git credentials to login [to the private packages feed.](https://msblox-03.visualstudio.com/csetypeedge)


## Create a new **TypeEdge** application
Here is the quickest way to get started with **TypeEdge**. In this quick start you will create an IoT Edge application with two modules and run it in the emulator:

1. Install the TypeEdge .NET Core solution template. Just type:
    ```
    dotnet new -i TypeEdge.Application
    ```

    >**Note:** to **upgrade to a newer template version**, you need to clear the dotnet http and template cache first
    ```
    dotnet nuget locals http-cache --clear
    dotnet new --debug:reinit
    ```
1. Copy the **iothubowner** connection string from your Azure **IoT Hub**.
    > The **iothubowner** is required because TypeEdge needs to provision a new device with the generated deployment configuration. 

1. Create a new IoT TypeEdge application:
    > You can customize the TypeEdge application and modules names when you use the template. In the next example, the application is called **Thermostat**, and the two modules are called **SensorModule** and **PreprocessorModule**. These names will be used as class names, so **Pascal casing** is suggested.
    ```
    dotnet new typeedgeapp -n Thermostat -m1 SensorModule -m2 PreprocessorModule -cs "YOUR_IOTHUBOWNER_CONNECTION" -cr YOUR_CONTAINER_REGISTRY
    ```
    >Note: a localhost registry is not supported at the moment.


## Build and debug the application

After you use the template to create a new **TypeEdge** application, all you have to do is build and run the emulator.

1. Navigate in the application folder:

        cd Thermostat

1. Open in VS Code/Visual Studio 2017 and hit F5:

    - For VS Code run
        
            code .

    - For VS 2017 run
        
            Thermostat.sln

    - To run the application in the command line (no IDE):
        ```
        dotnet build Thermostat.sln
        cd Thermostat.Emulator
        dotnet run
        ```

    >Note: In all three cases, your application is being emulated in-memory **without any containers involved**. This is very useful for quick develop and test iterations.

You should see now the Edge Hub starting up..

.. and the messages flowing in ..

## Containers debugging

If your modules have system dependencies and you want to debug them inside the containers, you can leverage the *docker support* feature of VS 2017. Simply right click the **docker-compose** project and start it from VS 2017 to **debug your application inside the docker containers**.


Alternatively, you can run your application inside the containers in command line:

    docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.override.yml up

> Note: To build the docker containers, temporarily you need to [add the private NuGet feed](#feed) first.

![](images/incontainer.png)

**Congratulations!** 

You just created your first **TypeEdge** application. Continue reading to learn how to deploy this application to an IoT Device, or take the time to understand [how it works](#how).

## Publish the Application

## 
1. ***Temporary step* <a name="feed">Private packages feed:</a>** To build the containers, you have to add the private packages source first. **Add your git credentials to the private repo** and run the below command. This will download nuget.exe and add the private packages source in your solution. 

        addPrivateSource.bat USERNAME PASSWORD

1. Now, you can build the container images:
    
        docker-compose build


1. The final step is to push these images to your docker registry. Make sure Docker can access your registry:

        docker login YOUR_REGISTRY -u YOUR_USERNAME -p YOUR_PASSWORD 

    Push the images to your registry

        docker-compose push

    >Note: The registry is configured in the .env file inside the root folder. **If you edit the .env file, make sure you run the the emulator afterwards** to update the cloud IoT Edge Device deployment configuration.

## Device Deployment
1. **Get the device connection string from Azure portal**, and on the device host run:

        iotedgectl setup --connection-string "THE_DEVICE_CONNECTION_STRING" --auto-cert-gen-force-no-passwords

    >Note: The device name is configured in the appsettings.json of the emulator project. **Make sure you run the emulator and rebuilt the containers if you change that name**. The emulator will provision a new device if the device does not exist.

1. If your registry requires authentication, you need to run 
    
        iotedgectl login --address YOUR_REGISTRY_ADDRESS --username YOUR_REGISTRY_USERNAME --password YOUR_REGISTRY_PASSWORD

1. Finally, start the runtime:
    
        iotedgectl start

## <a name="how">How it works</a>


**TypeEdge** uses C# code to define the behavior and structure of a module. A **TypeEdge** application is a collection of **TypeEdge Modules**.

### Module interface

**TypeEdge** leverages **interfaces** to define the structure and behavior of the modules. A typical example of a **TypeEdge module definition** is:  
 
 ```cs
[TypeModule]
public interface ISensorModule
{
    Output<SensorModuleOutput> Output { get; set; }
    ModuleTwin<SensorModuleTwin> Twin { get; set; }

    bool ResetModule(int sensorThreshold);
}
```
This module has a strongly typed output called ***Output*** and the messages type is ***SensorModuleOutput***. Similarly, it has a module twin called ***Twin*** with type ***SensorModuleTwin***
> Note: **TypeEdge** allows you to define multiple twin properties in the same module to enable partial twin updates

Finally, this module has a method that can be invoked directly with the following method signature:

```cs
bool ResetModule(int sensorThreshold);
```

### Module implementation

After describing the module behavior and structure with an interface, the next step is to implement the module interface. This is effectively the code that will run in the **TypeEdge** module. Here is an implementation example of the above interface:

<details>
  <summary>Click to see the full <b>SensorModule</b> implementation code</summary>

```cs
public class SensorModule : EdgeModule, ISensorModule
{
    public Output<SensorModuleOutput> Output { get; set; }
    public ModuleTwin<SensorModuleTwin> Twin { get; set; }

    public bool ResetModule(int sensorThreshold)
    {
        System.Console.WriteLine($"New sensor threshold:{sensorThreshold}");
        return true;
    }

    public override async Task<ExecutionResult> RunAsync()
    {
        while (true)
        {
            await Output.PublishAsync(
                new SensorModuleOutput() {
                    Data = new System.Random().NextDouble().ToString() });
            
            System.Threading.Thread.Sleep(1000);
        }
        return await base.RunAsync();
    }
} 
```
</details>
<br>
A <b>TypeEdge</b> module can override any of the virtual methods of the base class ``EdgeModule``. As demonstrated in the above example, the ``RunAsync`` method is used for defining long running loops, typically useful for modules that read sensor values. Another virtual method is ``Configure``, which can be used to read custom module configuration during startup.

The complete ``EdgeModule`` definition is:

```cs
public abstract class EdgeModule
{
    public virtual CreationResult Configure(IConfigurationRoot configuration);
    public virtual Task<ExecutionResult> RunAsync();
}
```

### Module Subscriptions
**TypeEdge** uses the pub/sub pattern for all module I/O, except for the direct methods. This means that a module can subscribe to other module outputs, and publish messages to their inputs. To do this, a reference to the module interface definition is required. **TypeEdge** uses dependency injection to determine the referenced modules. 

Below, is the constructor of the second module included in the application template called ``PreprocessorModule``, that references the ``SensorModule`` via its interface.

```cs
public PreprocessorModule(ISensorModule proxy)
{
    this.proxy = proxy;
}
```

Using this proxy, the ``PreprocessorModule`` module can interact with the ``SensorModule``:
```cs
proxy.Output.Subscribe(this, async (msg) =>
{
    await Output.PublishAsync(new PreprocessorModuleOutput()
    {
        Data = msg.Data,
        Metadata = System.DateTime.UtcNow.ToShortTimeString()
    });
    return MessageResult.OK;
});
```
In this example, the ``PreprocessorModule`` subscribes to ``SensorModule's`` output, called ``Output``, and defines a subscription handler, a delegate in other words  that will be called every time the ``SensorModule`` sends a messages through its ``Output ``.

The complete code of the template's ``PreprocessorModule`` is:

<details>
  <summary>Click to see the full <b>PreprocessorModule</b> implementation code</summary>

```cs
public class PreprocessorModule : EdgeModule, IPreprocessorModule
{
    public Output<PreprocessorModuleOutput> Output { get; set; }
    public ModuleTwin<PreprocessorModuleTwin> Twin { get; set; }

    public PreprocessorModule(ISensorModule proxy)
    {
        proxy.Output.Subscribe(this, async (msg) =>
        {
            await Output.PublishAsync(new PreprocessorModuleOutput()
            {
                Data = msg.Data,
                Metadata = System.DateTime.UtcNow.ToShortTimeString()
            });
            return MessageResult.OK;
        });
    }
}
```
</details>


### Emulator
The emulator references the Runtime bits to achieve the emulation. Under the hood, the emulator starts a console application that hosts the Edge Hub and all referenced modules. It will also provision a new Edge device to your designated IoT Hub. This device will contain the complete deployment manifest, ready to be used to an actual device deployment.

To reference modules in an emulator application, both the interface and the implementation class of the module are required:

```cs
host.RegisterModule<ISensorModule, Modules.SensorModule>();
```

Finally, all subscriptions beyond to context of a single module can be defined here. For example, an upstream route can be defined using:
```cs
host.Upstream.Subscribe(host.GetProxy<IPreprocessorModule>().Output);
```

Below is the complete template emulator code for reference.


<details>
  <summary>Click to see the full <b>emulator</b> code</summary>

```cs
public static async Task Main(string[] args)
{
    //TODO: Set your IoT Hub iothubowner connection string in appsettings.json
    var configuration = new ConfigurationBuilder()
        .AddJsonFile("appsettings.json")
        .AddEnvironmentVariables()
        .AddDotenvFile()
        .AddCommandLine(args)
        .Build();

    var host = new TypeEdgeHost(configuration);

    //TODO: Register your TypeEdge Modules here
    host.RegisterModule<ISensorModule, Modules.SensorModule>();
    host.RegisterModule<IPreprocessorModule, Modules.PreprocessorModule>();

    //TODO: Define all cross-module subscriptions 
    host.Upstream.Subscribe(host.GetProxy<IPreprocessorModule>().Output);

    host.Build();

    await host.RunAsync();

    Console.WriteLine("Press <ENTER> to exit..");
    Console.ReadLine();
}
```

</details>

### Proxy
**TypeEdge** also accelerates the service application development (cloud side application). The provided template will include a Proxy project, useful for cloud side interaction with the TypeEdge application. The code to call a direct method of a TypeEdge module from the could side is literally one line:

```cs
ProxyFactory.GetModuleProxy<ISensorModule>().ResetModule(4);
```

### Solution structure
Apparently, to reference the module definition interfaces and to avoid coupling the module implementation code together, these interfaces need to be defined in a separate project that will be commonly shared across the solution, containing only the definition interfaces and the referenced types.
